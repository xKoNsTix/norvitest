norvi- it was a BLAST ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥

I wasnÂ´t sure if i could code all the milestones i set myself but i did it. During developement of this project i totally fell in love with it. Because of this, i will continue to further develop norvi during the summer break. What i learned while developing it:

- Iterative developing came faster than expected 

- I need one more screen (or two).

- For some reason php was really hard for me. After a certain point in the project it wasnt anymore. I then could just implement features my mind developed. I really like being on this "skilllevel".

- Being able to combine php and databases and getting some experience with it, i created a lot of new ideas. Ideas i could never think of before beginning with this project.

- Maybe start earlier next time. Next time I can either decide between starting earlier, or cutting out freshly developed ideas in the end. (But i wrote them into a list, no worries.)

- Using git came in handy this time. I had to pull older versions sometimes because i messed up something.

- In the end leaflet is more powerful than I expected in the beginning.

- I really liked how so many i things i learned during my time at the FH merged together in this project. Sometimes you donÂ´t see the big picture until you step back and let it sink.


- CSS is more powerful than i thought. I totally fell in love with the campfire animation from the base camp screen aka index.php I will definetely go deeper into this topic during the summer and try to improve the fire itself. My plan is to make it bigger/different according to the user level. (I will try to gamify this platform a little bit and put in a very basic reward system.)

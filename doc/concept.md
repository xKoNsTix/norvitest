norvi -

An interactive map to see exactly how my work was done. 
The initial idea startet after lots of people asked me where i made my photos and how.
Norvi answers all these questions. 

Inspired by my last visit in Norway 2021 i made the campfire the "base" of the platform. The user will return to the base
after a successful exploration, just like I did last year.

norvi also has a login system. Users are able to add their own images and techniques. The idea of norvi is to 
help beginning photographers to just get done with the technical aspects of photography. 

norvi will be further developed during the summer while spending my free time in - you guessed it- the north.

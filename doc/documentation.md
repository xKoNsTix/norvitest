Known Bugs:
Displayphoto row 190 throws invalid due to spaces in path. Can not encode this properly. I have to choose between a non working link and a
valid file. I`ve chose the first option and looking forward to receive a feedback about that. Not only will the photo not show, but also the EXIF data will not be read properly due to a "wrong" path.
